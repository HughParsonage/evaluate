# Evaluate

Evaluate provides tools that allow you to recreate the parsing, evaluation and display of R code, with enough information that you can accurately recreate what happens at the command line.  

Evaluate + replay works very similarly to source, but is written in such a way to make it easy to adapt for other output formats, such as html or latex.
